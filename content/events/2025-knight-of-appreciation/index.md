The Norwin School District Community Foundation and the Norwin Alumni and Friends Association invite you and other leading community members to an appreciation dinner in recognition of your service to Norwin’s schools and communities.{{% /p %}}

This is not a fundraiser—just an opportunity for us to say thank you and to introduce you to the work of both the Norwin School District Community Foundation and the Norwin Alumni and Friends Association.

The Norwin School District Community Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit affiliated with the Norwin School District. Since its founding in 2007, the NSDCF has awarded over $1.3 million in scholarships and funded Educator Innovation Grants that have impacted thousands of students. Our mission, in partnership with NAFA, is to support students, educators, and educational programs through community-driven philanthropy. Through ongoing community support we aim to help Norwin maintain its status as a premier school district. 

Towards that end, please join us for a relaxed evening with fellow community leaders. No donations expected—just your presence.

Sincerely,
 
John C. “Jack” Boylan, D.Ed.
President,
