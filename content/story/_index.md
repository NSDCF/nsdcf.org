The Norwin School District Community Foundation is focused upon a single idea: *what if we can do more for our community and students?*
{{% /p %}}

Since 2007, the NSDCF has dedicated itself to supporting programs and activities benefiting students and residents of the Norwin School District, increasing community philanthropy, developing and administering scholarship funds for Norwin students, and supporting Norwin School District educational programs.

The results speak for themselves. We help Norwin graduates make college dreams a reality, seek to empower teachers to explore new ideas and opportunities to teach their students, and so much more.

## It all began with one scholarship{.slide__heading}
In 2007, the estate of Thomas J. and Gladys Sowash Stoker sought to endow a scholarship fund for Norwin High School students residing in the borough of Irwin, Pennsylvania. During this process, the idea of the Norwin School District Community came into existence as a 501(c)(3) charity. Through the NSDCF, community businesses and families are able to setup scholarships without the need for management fees that would otherwise cut into endowment funds, limiting the aid that can be provided to Norwin students.

That was just the beginning. Today, the NSDCF has grown to manage over 21 [community scholarships]({{< ref "/programs/scholarships" >}}), the [Educator Innovation Grant program]({{< ref "/programs/grants" >}}),Â two veteran [memorials]({{< ref "/programs/memorials" >}}) in the Norwin area, and support for the District's STEM/STEAM initiatives.{{% /slide %}}
