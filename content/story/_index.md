The estate of Thomas J. and Gladys Sowash Stoker bequeathed a sizable sum to create an endowment to provide scholarships for Norwin High School Students residing in the Borough of Irwin.  The funds could only be provided to a 501c3 charitable organization, thus the creation of the Norwin School District Community Foundation (NSDCF) in 2007.

Our mission is to engage in programs and activities benefiting primarily students and residents of Norwin School District, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, developing and increasing community philanthropy, developing and administering scholarship funds for students enrolled and attending Norwin School District and supporting Norwin School District in developing and administering educational programs.

Under the guidance of an all volunteer Board of Directors, the Norwin School District Community Foundation (NSDCF) has grown to manage 21 scholarships, an educator innovation grant program,  two veteran memorials within the Norwin area and  support for the District's STEM/STEAM initiatives through Pennsylvania's Educational Improvement Tax Credit Program (EITC) and individual donations.
