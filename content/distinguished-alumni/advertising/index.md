Each year, we are privileged with the opportunity to listen to the inspiring stories of Norwin alumni as we identify some of the most notable for recognition at the Knight of Distinguished Alumni. In recognizing these alumni, we are able to come together as a community to celebrete their achievments and inspire future generations.

These events could not succeed without the support of the local community. If you are interested in advertising in this year's program booklet, please submit the form below or [download a PDF copy](2020_distinguished_alumni_program_ads.pdf).
