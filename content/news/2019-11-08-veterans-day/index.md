This Veterans Day, consider spending time at two of the Norwin area's hometown veterans memorials such as the [Norwin Area Veterans Memorial]({{< ref "/programs/memorials" >}}), located beside Norwin High School and dedicated to Norwin graduates who gave their lives in military service to our country, and the [Norwin Vets 2000 Memorial]({{< ref "/programs/memorials" >}}), located in front of the North Huntingdon Township Townhouse and dedicated to the honorable service of Norwin area veterans.

At each Norwin school, annual Veterans Day assemblies recognize the service of area veterans and bring them together with students so that their stories can be shared with the next generation.

The NSDCF is proud to help enable this recognition through its management of funds for the ongoing maintenance of both of these local community memorials. If you would like to help support these memorials, please consider [donating]({{< ref "/donate" >}}) to their funds.
