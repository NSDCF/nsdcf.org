The NSDCF would like to congratulate this year's lucky NAFA *Luck & Loot* raffle winner, Jude Abraham. Jude was excited to take home $500 along with $100 in instant lottery tickets while helping support NAFA's mission.

Proceeds from the raffle will be used to help fund the Norwin Alumni & Friends Association's annual scholarships for graduating Norwin students.
