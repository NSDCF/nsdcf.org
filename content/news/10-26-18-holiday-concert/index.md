### River City Brass: America's Premiere Professional Band

The first American professional brass band to be organized in over 25 years, the River City Brass made its debut in 1981 at the Pittsburgh Symphony’s British Festival. Under its founder and Music Director, Bob Bernat, the band won such critical and audience acclaim that it quickly grew to become the most active professional concert band in America.

The River City Brass offers an upbeat revival of a tradition that was widespread at the turn of the century in this country. There were over 20,000 brass bands in the United States then. Today, the River City Brass is one of less than 100 brass bands in North America, and is the only year-round professional group of its kind in the country.

The RCB presents a popular regional concert series throughout Pittsburgh and surrounding Southwestern Pennsylvania communities that has grown to 35 concerts in five different venues. It also performs on tour for music festivals, performing arts series, and symphony pops series.

Most River City Brass performances showcase band members as soloists; guest soloists at the band’s subscription concerts have included celebrated brass bandsmen from Europe, Broadway singers, dancers, folk artists, and even a classical accordionist.

River City Brass is a non-profit organization supported, in part, by contributions from individuals, corporations, and foundations. Its board of directors includes a broad spectrum of corporate executives and cultural and community leaders from the Greater Pittsburgh region.

A local critic has said, “the nicest thing about River City Brass…is that the group puts the fun back into music. There’s no snobbishness in musicians or audience, no learned program notes, no extended ceremonial bows and credits. Just some good music that is sometimes nostalgic, sometimes quietly moving, and often rousing.” It’s what this brass band is all about. The programs are entertaining and the level of musicianship is superb.
