Recently, author Scott Brown has written a heart-warming book about this remarkable young man, which is the purpose of my email to you today. *A Noble Knight* details Dan's story of faith and courage. There are many references throughout the book regarding Dan's upbringing in the Norwin community and his educational and extra curricular experiences in the Norwin School District.

The book is being sold for $23, with a portion of book sales profits going to a scholarship being established in Dan's name. The scholarship will be administered through the Norwin School District Community Foundation.
