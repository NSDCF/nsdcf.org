We are grateful to the Norwin community for coming together to support the Foundation's mission during this year's Days of Giving. Despite the shared challenges facing us all during these difficult times, together we were able to meet our goal of raising over $7,500 in donations this year.<!--more-->

These funds will be used to directly benefit Norwin students through the Foundation's [programs]({{< ref "programs/" >}}).
