## Help show your support for Norwin veterans this Veterans Day

*Shirts are no longer available at this time. Thank you for your interest and support.*

Norwin schools are proud to host annual Veterans Day assemblies to recognize the service of Norwin veterans and bring them together with students. This year, the NSDCF is offering these shirts, white in both short and long sleeve, to help show our support.

Twenty-five percent of all proceeds will be donated to local veterans organizations. Orders are due by **October 17th**.

<p class="donation_form__small_msg">Shirts ordered online must be picked up locally at the Norwin Public Library's Coffee Shop on November 7th between 5pm and 7pm, as we are regrettably unable to ship orders. Please <a href="mailto:alumni@nsdcf.org">email us</a> with any questions.</p>
