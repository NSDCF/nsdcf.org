The selection process for the Third Annual Knight of Distinguished Alumni Recognition Dinner is well under way. Norwin has a long tradition of producing outstanding alumni, but some go even further in life. This event is a celebration of Norwinâ€™s past, present, and future as we honor the achievements of some of our most distinguished alumni and a graduating student on Thursday, May 23, 2019 at the Stratigos Banquet Center.

We are currently seeking advertisements from the local business community for our event program booklet. In addition to their advertisement, sponsors will also be recognized on the NSDCF+NAFA website.

The Knight of Distinguished Alumni is fully funded by private donations. Any profits netted through this event will be used to support the NAFA Scholarship Fund and other NAFA activities benefitting the Norwin community and students.

Your support can help make this event a success. Ad forms can be downloaded below, and you may email us at [hello@nsdcf.org](mailto:hello@nsdcf.org) with any further questions.
