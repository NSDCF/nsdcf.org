On the evening of May 24, two-hundred and fourteen guests came together to celebrate the lifetime accomplishments of ten Distinguished Norwin Alumni, one Distinguished Friend of Norwin, and our graduating NAFA Scholarship recipient.

Throughout the night, stories were told that crossed the decades and generations of Norwin alumni, and some of the most memorable lessons learned through a lifetime of effort were shared by our honorees.

For those who were unable to join us, take a moment to enjoy these photographs of the event.
