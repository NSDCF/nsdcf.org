## Help show your support for Norwin veterans this Veterans Day

Norwin schools are proud to host annual Veterans Day assemblies to recognize the service of Norwin veterans and bring them together with students. This year, the NSDCF is offering these shirts, white in both short and long sleeve, to help show our support.

Twenty-five percent of all proceeds will be donated to local veterans organizations. Orders are due by **November 30th**.

<p class="donation_form__small_msg"><br /><strong>Please Note:</strong> Prices include $1 handling fee. Online orders may be picked up in-person on December 13th, from 5 to 7pm, at Circleville United Methodist Church, 11600 Parkway Drive, North Huntingdon, PA 15642. Please <a href="mailto:alumni@nsdcf.org">email us</a> with any questions.</p>
