Thanks to more than 50 donors and increased contributions from every school within the Norwin School District, over $14,000.00 was raised during the 2022 Days of Giving, nearly doubling the campaign goal of $7500.00. This year’s donations will support Student scholarships, STEAM Programs, Educator Innovation Grants, Fine Arts Fund, Athletics & Activities Fund, Project Playground and NAFA Special Programs.

Ninety-nine percent of the money raised during the 2022 Days of Giving will go directly to
support Norwin scholarships and programs.

The Norwin School District Community Foundation’s 2022 Days of Giving Committee is especially grateful to Norwin faculty and staff (present and past), ASFCME Local 1474, many local citizens and the NSDCF Foundation Board of Directors for their outstanding support. The committee is also grateful to the following area businesses for their generous support:

* Norwin Teachers Federal Credit Union

* Stratigos Banquet Centre
* Luehm Candy Company
