In May 2025, the Norwin School District Community Foundation (NSDCF) awarded more than $190,000 in scholarships to Norwin High School students to support their continued education. This total includes 45 awards across 30 Foundation-facilitated scholarships. Since 2007, NSDCF has awarded over $1.35 million in scholarships.

NSDCF administers scholarships on behalf of families and organizations who wish to honor a loved one or give back to the Norwin school community. Each fund is managed as a savings account or endowed investment, providing an annual scholarship while continuing to grow so that it can support students in perpetuity.
