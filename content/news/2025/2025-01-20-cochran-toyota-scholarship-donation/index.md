In a continued commitment to supporting local students, #1 Cochran Toyota recently presented Jack Boylan with a $3,500 donation to the Norwin School District Community Foundation. This contribution will fund the 2025 #1 Cochran Toyota Scholarship, which will be awarded in May 2025 to a graduating Norwin High School senior.

The #1 Cochran Toyota Scholarship is designed to encourage students pursuing higher education in fields related to the automotive industry. Eligible students may attend an automotive technical school, pursue business or finance-related majors, or enroll at a Pennsylvania college or university that aligns with a successful career in the auto industry.

This annual scholarship, first established in 2019 with an initial donation of nearly $19,000, has grown with additional contributions over the years. Since 2021, #1 Cochran Toyota has maintained its generous tradition of offering this scholarship opportunity to Norwin students each year.

Students interested in applying for the #1 Cochran Toyota Scholarship, as well as any of the over [thirty-three other scholarships](/programs/scholarships/) managed by the Norwin School District Community Foundation, can find details on the foundation’s website. Current seniors are encouraged to reach out to the Norwin Senior High School’s guidance office for application information.

Since 2007, the Norwin School District Community Foundation has managed scholarships totaling over $996,900, benefiting countless students in the Norwin community. Contributions like those from #1 Cochran Toyota are instrumental in providing these opportunities and supporting the aspirations of local graduates.
