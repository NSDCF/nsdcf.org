We'd like to take a moment to remind Norwin teachers reading that applications for the NSDCF's latest round of Educator Innovation Grants are due no later than March 20, 2024. This year, EIG grant applications requesting up to $2,000 will be considered.

The Educator Innovation Grant (EIG) program offers competitive grants to Norwin educators to support the implementation of innovative and creative programs aimed at enhancing student learning. Since its launch in 2011, the NSDCF has distributed well over $17,000 in grants for projects that have benefited thousands of Norwin students. These grants provide teachers with the opportunity to explore bold new ideas and refine them, with the ultimate aim of integrating them into the broader Norwin curriculum and educational experience.

Please contact [Dr. Jack Boylan](mailto:jack.boylan@nsdcf.org) by email if you would like to apply for this round of the [Educator Innovation Grant](/programs/grants/) program.
