Recently, the Norwin School District Community Foundation [offered shirts]({{< ref "2018-10-08-veterans-day-shirts/index.md" >}}) to the Norwin community meant to celebrate and honor the sacrifices and service of our nation's veterans with a unique Norwin design.

At each of the Veteran's Day assemblies held throughout the Norwin School District this year, veterans on stage were greeted with the sight of hundreds of Norwin students of all ages wearing shirts proudly declaring *U__Knight__ed We Stand*.

Now, the NSDCF is proud to announce that twenty-five percent of the proceeds of these sales have been donated to two Norwin-area veterans organizations: the VFW Post 781 Honor Guard of Irwin, Pennsylvania, and the North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania chapter of Wreaths Across America.

### Wreaths Across America

Each December, [Wreaths Across America](https://www.wreathsacrossamerica.org/) remembers our fallen U.S. veterans by coordinating a nationwide series of wreath-laying ceremonies at more than 1,400 cemeteries. Their mission started in 1992 with laying wreaths at Arlington National Cemetery, and since 2005, has expanded to U.S. veterans graves throughout the world.

The NSDCF's donation will be used to support the [North Huntingdon chapter's](https://www.wreathsacrossamerica.org/pages/42733/Overview/?relatedId=0) wreath-laying ceremonies at Union Cemetery and Immaculate Conception Cemetery in Irwin, Pennsylvania on Saturday, December 15, 2018 at 12pm.

### VFW Post 781 Honor Guard

The Honor Guard of VFW Post 781 of Irwin, Pennsylvania is a volunteer group of veterans who are called upon to provide military funeral honors for qualified veterans when requested. Military honors are a final recognition of a veterans' service on behalf of a grateful nation.

VFW Post 781 is the Irwin, Pennsylvania post for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the United States' largest and oldest war verterans service organization, and is located at 100 Billott Avenue.
