On the evening of May 24, two-hundred and fourteen guests came together to celebrate the lifetime accomplishments of ten Distinguished Norwin Alumni, one Distinguished Friend of Norwin, and our graduating NAFA Scholarship recipient.

Those honored included **William Caruthers, Esq. (1973), Hon. Mark Critz (1980), Dr. Constance DeMore (1991), Dr. Robin Dillon (1973), Dr. Heather Newell (1988), Mr. Dan Priatko (1980) and Mr. Rich Siniawski (1966)**.  In addition, **Mr. Casey Harper** was honored as a **Distinguished Friend** of Norwin.

This Second Annual Knight of Distinguished Alumni Recognition Dinner was sponsored by the **Duncan Financial Group** and further supported by numerous businesses and individuals through congratulatory ads placed in the commemorative program booklet.

Following welcome messages from **Dr. Jack Boylan** (President, Norwin School District Community Foundation) and **Mrs. Debbie Kunkle** (President, Norwin Alumni and Friends Association), the honorees and guests enjoyed a delicious buffet dinner and dessert.  Emcee **Bo Garritano** then introduced each honoree who was presented a plaque. Throughout the night, stories were told that crossed the decades and generations of Norwin alumni, and some of the most memorable lessons learned through a lifetime of effort were shared by our honorees.

The wall opposite the entrance to the Norwin High School Auditorium now holds a plaque to honor each of Norwin's Distinguished Alumni.

Nominations for the 2019 Class of Distinguished Alumni will begin in October, 2018.  Any graduate from a Norwin Area Public School is eligible to be nominated.  You can find the criteria for nomination and the nomination for at www.nsdcf.org.
