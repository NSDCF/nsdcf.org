Have you wished there were ways to support Norwin academics like we do athletics?  Well, read on and we can make your wish come true.

Annually, during the week of Norwin’s Homecoming Celebration, the Norwin School District Community Foundation sponsors the Days of Giving (DoG) to raise funds to support Norwin’s students and programs.<!--more-->

The goal for the 2020 Days of Giving Campaign is to raise $7,500.00 that will be applied to one or more of the following programs:

* To grow our smallest scholarship endowment funds so students who earn these scholarships will have more substantial financial support as they begin their post high school education.  These scholarships currently provide awards in the range of $400-600 which may only cover the cost of one or two college textbooks.
* To grow the Norwin Alumni and Friends Association (NAFA) Scholarship which currently provides $500 annually.
* To add funds to any scholarship facilitated by the Foundation.  You can find a listing of [eligible scholarships]({{< ref "programs/scholarships/index.md" >}}) on our website.
* To support Norwin’s K-12 STEM programs--Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics--to provide students and teachers with the specialized STEM curriculum resources needed to support STEM instruction.

You may target your donation to any of the above priorities or allow the Foundation to make that determination for you.

Please visit the Norwin School District Community Foundation website at *[nsdcf.org/donate]({{< ref "/donate/" >}})* to make your tax-deductible gift during the Days of Giving between Wednesday, September 30, 2020 through Sunday, October 4, 2020.

If you prefer to donate via check, please make your donation payable to:  Norwin School District Community Foundation 281 McMahon Drive North Huntingdon 15642 (On the Memo Line, indicate the fund you wish to support.)
