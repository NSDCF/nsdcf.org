Sincere thanks to all those who donated to this year’s NSDCF Day of Giving on Wednesday, September 20th, 2017. Your generosity provided funds to support our Educator Innovation Grants.  In addition, one person donated to support the David J. Nelson Scholarship Fund.

We plan to conduct a Day of Giving annually on the Wednesday of Homecoming Week.  Let’s increase participation and donations in 2018!
