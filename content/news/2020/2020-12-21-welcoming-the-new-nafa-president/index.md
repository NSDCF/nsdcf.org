The Norwin Alumni & Friends Association proudly welcomes its new president, Ms. Lynn Clark,'75 and looks forward to a bright future under her leadership.<!--more-->

{{< img src="lynn-clark-headshot.jpg" class="img--wide-right" >}}

For over thirty-five years, Clark has taught the children of southwestern Pennsylvania at Norwin, Uniontown, Mt. Pleasant, and with the Diocese of Pittsburgh. At Norwin, Clark has served as a student council advisor, is an American Red Cross certified instructor in CPR, first aid, and water safety, and volunteers for local food banks and with NAFA.

Clark earned her BS in Health and Physical Education from Slippery Rock State College, an MS in Health Education from Penn State University, and her Elementary Education certification from Seton Hill College.

Clark follows in the footsteps of Ms. Debbie Kunkle, who served as NAFA's president for five years and worked tirelessly to bring the Norwin Alumni & Friends Association to life. Though we are sad to see her tenure come to an end, NAFA is a fitting legacy that will continue to grow over time.

On behalf of NAFA's leadership and the Norwin School District Community Foundation, we cannot adequately express our heartfelt thanks to Ms. Debbie Kunkle for her work.
