Thanks to the 30+ donors and the contributions from every school within the Norwin School District, over $4300 was raised during the 2019 Days of Giving with over $3900 directed towards scholarships managed by the NSDCF and the reamining donations applied to STEM, Educator Innovation Grants and NAFAâ€™s Fundraising for the Generations.
