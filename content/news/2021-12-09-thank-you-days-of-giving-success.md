Thanks to generous support of our community donors and contributions from teachers and staff within the Norwin School District, the Norwin School District Community Foundation raised over $11,300 during the 2021 Days of Giving.

Over $9,100 of the total raised will go to scholarships managed by the NSDCF, with the remainder of funds directed towards STEM programs, Educator Innovation Grants, our Fine Arts Fund, and Project Playground. Ninety-nine percent of all money raised went directly to support Norwin scholarships and programs.

The NSDCF Board of Directors are especially grateful to past and present Norwin faculty and staff, ASFMCE Local 1474, and all who help support both the Norwin School District Community Foundation and the Norwin Alumni & Friends Association.

The Days of Giving take place annually from Wednesday through Sunday of Norwin's Homecoming Week. Of course, you [may donate]({{< ref "donate/index.md" >}}) to the NSDCF at any time during the year.

The Norwin School District Community Foundation is a 501\(c\)3 charitable non-profit.
