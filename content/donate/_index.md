During Norwin's Homecoming Week September 23-29, the NSDCF holds its annual Days of Giving, an opportunity to support your school community through tax-deductible donations for school programs and scholarships benefitting Norwin students.  Though donations are accepted throughout the year, the Days of Giving Campaign is the Foundation’s annual outreach for contributions to support its programs.

### 2024 Goals

Our goal is to raise $15,000 during this year's Days of Giving, which will be used to support the following programs:

* *Student Scholarships* Your support will help us grow the Norwin Alumni & Friends Association's scholarships along with our smallest [scholarship endowments](/programs/scholarships/), ensuring that they continue to support Norwin graduates long into the future.
* *Educator Innovation Grants* Our [Educator Innovation Grants](/programs/) is a competitive grant process that awards start-up funds to Norwin teachers looking to innovate with new ideas to go beyond the basic curriculum and enhance student learning.
* *A+ Spaces* A re-envisioning of Norwin's existing STEM/STEAM programs, *A+ Spaces* supports upgrades to academic, arts, athletics, and activities facilities and programs. For more information, contact Lauren at
[steiner.lauren@norwinsd.org](mailto:steiner.lauren@norwinsd.org).

Through your support, the Norwin School District Community Foundation is able to help make college dreams reality through scholarships, empower Norwin teachers to explore bold new opportunities for their students with Educator Innovation Grants, open the minds of our students to a world of opportunity through STEM education and summer camps, and so much more.

You have the power to direct your donation to any of the aforementioned priorities, or you can trust the Foundation to allocate it where it's needed most. Whatever your choice, your donation can have a profound impact on the lives of Norwin students.

On behalf Norwin students and teachers, the NSDCF thanks you for your continued support.

*&mdash;Dr. Jack Boylan, President, NSDCF*
