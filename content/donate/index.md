Our goal for the 2019 campaign is to raise $7,500 that will be applied to one or more of the following programs:

* To grow our smallest scholarship endowment funds so students who earn these scholarships will have more substantial financial support as they begin their post high school education. These scholarships currently provide awards in the range of $175-$250 which may only cover the cost of one college textbook. 
* To add funds to any [community scholarship]({{< ref "/programs/scholarships/index.md" >}}) facilitated by the Foundation.
* To provide additional funding for Norwinâ€™s K-12 STEM programs (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in order to provide students and teachers with the specialized STEM curricular resources needed to support STEM instruction.
* To provide funding for Educator Innovation Grants, a competitive program to provide start-up funds for teachers to provide innovative instruction to enrich and enhance student learning. The CPR and Stop the Bleed curriculums started with Educator Innovation Grants as have numerous initiatives to create hands-on lessons to enhance student learning. 
* To support the NAFA Fundraising for the Generations initiative to raise $20,000 in 2020 to build the NAFA Scholarship Endowment.
* To the NSDCF General Fund, with donations redirected according to need amongst the programs managed by the NSDCF.

Whether it's to help a new graduate hoping to become the first member of their family to attend college, or a grant for a teacher looking to transform the way their students learn, your donation can have a profound impact on the lives of Norwin students. On behalf Norwin students and teachers, the NSDCF thanks you for your continued support.

&mdash;Dr. Jack Boylan, President, NSDCF
