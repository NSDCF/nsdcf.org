# Donate

Your tax deductible donation allows us to connect people and create partnerships within and around the Norwin community. We support scholarships, Norwin educational programs and students, and community philanthropy.  You may choose to make a donation and allow the Foundation Directors determine which program to apply your donation.  If you wish to target your donation to a specific program facilitated by the NSDCF or create an endowment fund to create a new program, contact Dr. Jack Boylan at dr.jcboylan@gmail.com or call 724-219-9260.
