Starting a fund with the Norwin School District Community Foundation is a great way to benefit Norwin students and programs for years to come. Because of our unique relationship with Norwin School District and the efforts of our volunteer Board, there are minimal overhead or administrative costs for the Foundation to bear. That means your donation or endowment will be implemented as you desire.

Please browse through the documents below to learn more about our funds and how you can be a part of creating a great future for Norwin students. For more information, please contact the Foundation's President, Dr. Jack Boylan, at 724-219-9260 or at dr.jcboylan@gmail.com.
