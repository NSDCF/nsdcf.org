Many of the Foundation's efforts, from smaller outings to our annual Knight of Distinguished Alumni, are only possible thanks to the dedication of our many volunteers. If you would like to learn more or offer your time, please contact us [via email](mailto:hello@nsdcf.org?subject=Volunteer%20Opportunities). We look forward to working with you to benefit Norwin students.
