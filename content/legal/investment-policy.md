The following guidelines have been adopted by the Board of Directors of the Norwin School District Community Foundation and are to be shared with active portfolio managers responsible for investing the long term investments held for endowment purposes. The intention of the Norwin School District Community Foundation is to use the funds to provide scholarships to students of Norwin School District, and to enhance educational programs offered by the Norwin School District.

### Distributions

The Board of Directors will make periodic distributions, consistent with the terms

### Objectives

The Norwin School District Community Foundation has adopted a long-term time horizon for the investment of the funds. The objectives are long-term capital growth, preservation of capital, income generation and the realization of acceptable investment returns commensurate with acceptable levels of risk. The Board of Directors believes that a balanced approach to portfolio management is required to reduce volatility and prudently maximize total return for the long term. It is expected that the Investment Manager(s) will manage the portfolio to seek to achieve these objectives at all times. The Board of Directors does not desire a high risk, high volatility approach that produces large gains as well as large losses. Rather, we seek a more consistent approach, limited to individual intermediate-term fixed income securities and/or fixed income mutual funds, which may include U.S. Government Treasuries and Agencies, Mortgage Backed Securities (High yield investments limited to no more than 5% of the portfolio), and Money Market Instruments.

Exposure to Corporate bonds should be limited to 15% (including no more than 5% in high yield corporates) of the portfolio.

These limits are subject to periodic review and adjustments by the Investment Manager with Board of Directors’ approval.
2. The maximum remaining maturity (or estimated average life on the mortgage-backed issues, or secure mortgage backed securities held in Mutual Funds) on each bond is limited to 7 years.

4. Corporate securities are limited, by issuer, to 5% of the total fixed income assets under management.

6. Zero coupon bonds are not considered as acceptable investments.
7. International fixed income investments may be used if deemed appropriate by the Investment Manager(s).

#### Equity Guidelines

2. Stock investment shall not exceed 1% of the total equity outstanding of that company.
3. International equity investments may be used if deemed appropriate by the Investment Manager(s).
