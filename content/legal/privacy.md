Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us. It is the Norwin School District Community Foundation's ("NSDCF") policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect on www.nsdcf.org.

### Visitors

As with most websites, NSDCF collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. NSDCF's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how NSDCF's visitors use its website. From time to time, NSDCF may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

NSDCF also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, administer www.nsdcf.org, and as part of our efforts to statistical efforts to better monitor and understand user behavior and website traffic.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to NSDCF's websites choose to interact with NSDCF in ways that require NSDCF to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that NSDCF gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, visitors submitting forms via our website provide an email address for us to contact them by. Those who engage in donations to the NSDCF or become members for the Norwin Alumni & Friends Association are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. Financial transactions are processed through Paypal, a third-party service, in accordance with their respective terms of service and privacy policy. NSDCF maintains a periodic email newsletter, used to occasionally send relevant information about NSDCF, the Norwin Alumni & Friends Association, and appropriate updates regarding the Norwin School District and community to those who choose to opt-in to this service. Users can opt-out of future emails at any time.

In each case, NSDCF collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with NSDCF. NSDCF does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

NSDCF may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, NSDCF may monitor web traffic, visitor behavior, and other similiar data. NSDCF may display this information publicly or provide it to others in an effort to improve the NSDCF website. However, NSDCF does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

NSDCF discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on NSDCF's behalf or to provide services available at NSDCF's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using NSDCF's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. NSDCF will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, NSDCF discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when NSDCF believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of NSDCF, third parties or the public at large. If you have supplied your email address to NSDCF and opted-in to our newsletter, NSDCF may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with NSDCF and our work. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it after removing personally-identifying information in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. NSDCF takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. NSDCF uses cookies to help NSDCF identify and track visitors, their usage of NSDCF website, and their website access preferences. NSDCF visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using NSDCF's websites, with the drawback that certain features of NSDCF's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Privacy Policy Questions
Although most changes are likely to be minor, NSDCF may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at NSDCF's sole discretion. NSDCF encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
