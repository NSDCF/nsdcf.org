Many educational grants require matching funds, without which the grant cannot be accepted. The Norwin Educational Giving Fund helps provide those matching funds to Norwin educators, in addition to providing additional financial support for the [Educator Innovation Grants]({{<ref "programs/grants" >}}) program.
