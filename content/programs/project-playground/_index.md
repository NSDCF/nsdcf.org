Project Playground is an effort by the Norwin PTAs to replace and upgrade playground equipment at Norwin's four elementary schools. This initiative is meant to provide new and exciting opportunities for physical education and cooperative play for Norwin's K-4 children, inclusivity for children with disabilities, and be available to the local community outside school hours.

## The Initiative

Project Playground is spearheaded by the Norwin PTAs in cooperation with the Norwin School District and the Norwin School District Community Foundation. The project seeks to raise a total of $600,000 over the next several years, with construction taking place at each school as funds are made available.

In partnering with the NSDCF, a 501\(c\)3 non-profit charitable organization, Project Playground is able to offer donors added tax benefits for their donations.
