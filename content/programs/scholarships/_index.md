The Norwin School District Community Foundation facilitates 21 scholarships to benefit graduating Norwin High School seniors in their quest to achieve higher education at a university, college, or technical school.

Each scholarship has specific criteria of eligibility for the award and a selection committee that screens the applications and chooses the awardee(s).
