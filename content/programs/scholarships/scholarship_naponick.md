title = "Naponick Family Scholarship"
+++

Mike Naponick was born in western Pennsylvania in 1910, the son of immigrant parents. Mike had an outstanding scholastic career academically and athletically. Financial pressures forced him out of the classroom and into the coal mines. He was unable to accept a scholarship to attend a prep school as he was forced to work to support his family. Until his death in 1992, Mike was an avid supporter of Norwin High School. Mike and Twila, his wife, are the proud parents of John and Paul and guided them through their academic and sports careers. Following Mike’s death, the Naponick Family decided a scholarship fund in his memory was something Mike would have approved, not to aggrandize himself, but to assist young student athletes in their progress down the road of life. The Naponick Family Scholarship is to be awarded to a Norwin High School student in their senior year who:

* Is a “hustler”, a student who through determination and character performs above his/her expected level of ability.
* Possesses qualities of leadership and appropriate academic achievement. Class rankings will not be the sole criteria but whether he/she works to the best of his/her academic capabilities.
* Participates in interscholastic programs at Norwin High School
* Plans to attend an accredited college, university or trade school.
* Demonstrates the need for financial assistance.
* Submits the application form approved by the Advisory Committee, along with an explanation why he/she wishes to be considered for the Naponick Family Scholarship and how he/she meets the qualifying criteria.
* Is selected by the Advisory Committee.
