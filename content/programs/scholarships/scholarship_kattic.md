Donald, G. Kattic, a retired Norwin High School teacher and Marine Veteran, lived a life of service to Norwin School District and the Norwin Community. A long time Commander of VFW Post 781, Mr. Kattic worked tirelessly to support area veterans. A number of memorials to military veterans were renovated or constructed by the sheer will power of Mr. Kattic. The Norwin Area Veterans Memorial that graces the Norwin Campus is just one example of Mr. Katticâ€™s passion to honor veterans, especially our fallen heroes. This scholarship is awarded to a Norwin HIgh School Senior who demonstrates an active life of service to school and community, leadership qualities and giving his/her best effort at all times.
