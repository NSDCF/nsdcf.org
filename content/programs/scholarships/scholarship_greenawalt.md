Timothy Lee Greenawalt was a fun, loving, independent, fearless, happy go lucky type of person. He almost always had a smile on his face and projected positivity everywhere he went.

He often liked to be silly and would playfully joke and prank while spending time with family and friends. He spent his free time going to concerts, listening to music, riding dirt bikes, skateboarding, or riding his BMX bike. He was smart and did well academically.

While at Norwin, he enjoyed classes such as gym, art, graphics, drafting, and other subjects that fall within the engineering field. He participated in activities such as snowboarding and enjoyed being a part of the Norwin Ski Club. He enjoyed being at Norwin as he was a social and friendly person. Tim was protective of those he loved and supportive to anyone he could be. He enjoyed family vacations at the beach. He especially liked going boogie boarding, playing games on the boardwalk, and appeasing his siblings with taking photos. He didn’t just enjoy the things he liked on his own, he always tried and was successful at engaging with others and having them join in with him. He was often thoughtful and caring of others and the community. He loved anything adrenaline related and truly fulfilled the lyric “live fast die young”. He was a soul that lived beyond his time and is missed by a community of people.
