title = "Thomas P. Shrump Memorial Scholarship"
+++

Thomas P. Shrump was a dedicated volunteer to the Norwin Band and Colorguard while his children performed for Norwin High School. What separates Mr. Shrump from most other volunteers is that he continued to provide valuable volunteer service to the band and colorguard after his children graduated from Norwin High School until his unexpected passing. Mr. Shrumpâ€™s family and friends have created this scholarship to honor and memorialize this selfless supporter of the performing arts.

The recipient of this scholarship will be selected from band and colorguard graduating seniors beginning in 2022. Details on the scholarship amount and application process will be provided in spring of 2022.
