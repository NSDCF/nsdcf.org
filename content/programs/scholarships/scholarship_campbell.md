title = "Hugh and Marion Campbell Scholarship"
+++

Marion Campbell passed away in November of 2019. Mrs. Campbell and her late husband Hugh established Campbell’s Service Center located on Clay Pike in 1963. Today the facility, operated by their son Hugh Campbell, continues as one of only a handful of truly “Full Service” gasoline repair stations in western Pennsylvania. This scholarship reflects the Campbell Family’s passion for community, small business and the automotive repair trade.

The Hugh and Marion Campbell Memorial Scholarship is to be awarded to a Norwin High School student in their senior year, in the amount of $500.00, who:

* Completes the required scholarship application, as instructed;
* Will be continuing their education as an automotive technician, preferably in a program of studies not sponsored by an automobile manufacturer;
* Best exemplifies the qualities established by the Advisory Committee as delineated on the application cover letter; and
* Is selected by the Advisory Committee.
