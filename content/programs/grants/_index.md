The Educator Innovation Grant (EIG) program is a competitive grant up to $1000.00 to support educator efforts to enhance and enrich student learning.  Applicants must be teachers within Norwin School District and are required to complete a detailed application demonstrating how the grant will engage students in innovative ways.  The EIGs are meant to be start-up funds and the proposed innovative programs should be able to be continued with District allotted funding.  The number of awards is determined by the amount of funds raised during the year.
