The Educator Innovation Grant (EIG) program is a competitive grant up to $1000.00 to support educator efforts to enhance and enrich student learning.  Applicants must be teachers within Norwin School District and are required to complete a detailed application demonstrating how the grant will engage students in innovative ways.  The EIGs are meant to be start-up funds and the proposed innovative programs should be able to be continued with District allotted funding.  The number of awards is determined by the amount of funds raised during the year.

Since the inception of the Educator Innovations Grant program in 2011 through today, the Norwin School District Community Foundation has distributed a total of $9,735 in grants for projects that have benefitted about 2,400 students.

The Foundation reviews applications in April and awards the grants during Teacher Appreciation Week in May. Grants can be put to use as early as August or anytime during that following school year.
