The area's newest memorial, located at the top of the main driveway to Norwin High School, is designed to honor Norwin area graduates from 1958 to present who have lost their lives while serving our country.  If you would like to contribute to the maintenance fund for this memorial, contact Dr. Jack Boylan at dr.jcboylan@gmail.com.
