Erected in front of the North Huntingdon Township Townhouse for the year 2000, this memorial honors local servicemen and women. It is a peaceful spot for reflection, meditation and prayer. If you would like to add a brick or contribute to the maintenance of this plaza, contact Dr. Jack Boylan [via email](mailto:jack.boylan@nsdcf.org).
