The Norwin Alumni & Friends Association is excited to begin its one time *Fundraising for the Generations* initiative, with the goal of raising $20,000 in 2020 by asking Norwin alumni, community members, and friends to donate just $10. The funds raised will be used to grow the Norwin Alumni Scholarship fund, which offers graduating Norwin seniors with scholarships to aid them in their pursuit of higher education opportunities. 

For many of us, the Norwin School District and community helped shape us into the people we are today by providing us with the solid foundation and core principles we continue to utilize in our everyday lives.

Today is an opportunity to give back and help the next generation of Norwin students. We believe we have the power in our numbers. By asking each Norwin alumni to donate just $10 towards the initiative, we can reach our goal. Help us spread the word through social media and let all of your fellow classmates know about this important opportunity to give back to Norwin students.
