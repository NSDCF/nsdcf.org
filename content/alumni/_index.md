The Norwin Alumni and Friends Association is a group of Norwin graduates and others who have come to appreciate and respect Norwin. To assure that Norwin always remains as a highly regarded premier school district, alumni and friends of Norwin, in partnership with the Norwin School District Community Foundation, have created the Norwin Alumni and Friends Association (NAFA).

NAFA will be as effective and fun as its members want it to be.  Become a member and help build the foundation of NAFA to assure it has a positive impact on its members and the Norwin schools, students and community.
