For most graduates (and friends!!) of Norwin High School, there remain fond memories of friendships, teachers and activities. Most would agree that Norwin prepared them well to take that next life step toward further education and/or career. Most are proud to say they are Norwin graduates (or friends) and desire to always see Norwin being that place where students have high quality opportunities to learn and grow.

The Norwin Alumni and Friends Association is a group of Norwin graduates and others who have come to appreciate and respect Norwin.  To assure that Norwin always remains as a highly regarded premier school district, alumni and friends of Norwin, in partnership with the Norwin School District Community Foundation, have created the Norwin Alumni and Friends Association (NAFA) whose goals are:

- To provide members a common source of information regarding NSD initiatives and activities;
- To provide members a directory to locate classmates and friends;
- To provide a forum for alumni to network for business or personal reasons;
- To provide outings and activities to build ongoing camaraderie and friendships;
- To partner with the Norwin School District Community Foundation, a  501 (c) (3) charitable organization, to support the Norwin School District through supplemental funding of programs and initiatives to assure quality educational experiences for Norwin students.

Activities being considered include participation in the Homecoming Carnival and Parade, an annual Norwin Pride Dinner, a 5K splash run, creation of an alumni scholarship, alumni travel opportunities, and alumni social outings.  NAFA will be as effective and fun as its members want it to be.  Become a founding member and help build the foundation of NAFA to assure its positive impact on its members, and the Norwin schools and community.

To join or for additional information, contact Debbie Kunkle, NAFA President at djk721@verizon.net or join the group's Facebook group, Norwin Alumni and Friends.

## Current Efforts

For over 100 years, Norwin Area Public Schools have helped prepare students for the next phases of their lives. Some of our current projects are as follows:

### NORWIN STUDENT SCHOLARSHIPS
Norwin Alumni and Friends Association is dedicated to helping Norwin students achieve higher education. In order to play a part in their future success, NAFA will award an annual scholarship to an outstanding Norwin Graduate as they set out to further their education and horizons. This year's scholarship will be $500.00. It is hoped this amount will grow over the years.

If you would like to contribute to the Scholarship Fund, send your tax deductible donation to Norwin Alumni & Friends Association c/o Norwin School District 281 McMahon Drive North Huntingdon, PA 15642. Please make your check payable to Norwin School District Community Foundation and on the Memo Line write NAFA Scholarship.

### NORWIN ALUMNI OF DISTINCTION
Many Norwin Alumni have gone on to successful careers and the Norwin Alumni and Friends Association is privileged to have the opportunity to recognize these distinguished alumni for their life achievements at an Annual Dinner where they will be honored for their life achievements. Awardees will receive a plaque for home and a second plaque will be placed on the "Wall of Fame" across from the entrance to the Norwin High School Auditorium.
