*Nominations for Norwin's upcoming class of Distinguished Alumni are now being accepted. [Learn more]({{< ref "/news/2021-10-03-distinguished-alumni-nominations/index.md" >}}).*

The Norwin Alumni and Friends Association is a group of Norwin graduates and others who have come to appreciate and respect Norwin. To assure that Norwin always remains as a highly regarded premier school district, alumni and friends of Norwin, in partnership with the Norwin School District Community Foundation, have created the Norwin Alumni and Friends Association (NAFA).

NAFA will be as effective and fun as its members want it to be.  Become a member and help build the foundation of NAFA to assure it has a positive impact on its members and the Norwin schools, students and community.

##### [Knight of Distinguished Alumni]({{< ref "/distinguished-alumni/" >}})

For decades, Norwin graduates have gone on to achieve great things and leave their mark on the world. Each year, NAFA is privileged to recognize the achievements of some of our most distinguished alumni during the [Knight of Distinguished Alumni]({{< ref "/distinguished-alumni/" >}}). In recognizing their achievements, we are better able to inspire future Norwin graduates as they follow in their footsteps.

##### Supporting Current Norwin Students

Since 2017, NAFA has awarded its annual scholarship to one graduating Norwin senior who has been accepted to a college or trade school and has at least one parent who is a Norwin graduate. Applications for this scholarship are available each year through the Norwin High School guidance office.

For younger students, NAFA offers two [summer camp scholarships]({{< ref "/programs/summer-camp/index.md" >}}) to help students attend Norwin's STEM-focused summer camps each year.
