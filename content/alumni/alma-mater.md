On a grassy hillside<br />
Spacious wide to see,<br />
Stands our Alma Mater,<br />
We will sing of thee.

Norwin High forever,<br />
We will strive to be<br />
Always faithful, loyal,<br />
Norwin, Dear, to thee:

With her colors bright,<br />
Our banner gleams so true,<br />
Making hearts beat right,<br />
For our own gold and blue.
